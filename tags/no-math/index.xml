      <description>This article addresses a very serious topic in our post-slavery, post-colonisation and post-segregation world.

These differences move part of the public opinion - and that should move everyone by the way because this problem is not going to resolve only with minorities.
This post will expose and explain a situation where Black Lives Mattered less.</description>

      <description>Were you aware that there is an official French decision tree to orient patients towards relevant medical services, depending on their Covid-19 related symptoms? I transformed it into a point-based scoring system (100% logically equivalent), so that a patient can compute his/her score by adding simple weights. Using these Covid-19 orientation algorithms, a more general comparative analysis is carried out concerning decision trees and scoring systems.
