      <title>Death sentences and race-ethnicity</title>

      <description>This post will present and explain a situation where Black Lives Mattered less. In Oklahoma, from 1990 to 2012, 143 offenders were sentenced to death. In 2017, Pierce et al.1 collected and analyzed the homicide data (4668 offenders) and the death sentences. It shows that there are several race/ethnicity effects involved in the death sentences outcomes. The paper contains all details. Terminology used (&amp;ldquo;nonwhite&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;race&amp;rdquo;) comes from the paper. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the &amp;ldquo;nonwhite&amp;rdquo; term, but I cannot easily replace it each time with Black, Hispanic, Native American and Asian.</description>

      <description>Were you aware that there is an official French decision tree to orient patients towards relevant medical services, depending on their Covid-19 related symptoms? I transformed it into a point-based scoring system (100% logically equivalent), so that a patient can compute his/her score by adding simple weights. Using these Covid-19 orientation algorithms, a more general comparative analysis is carried out concerning decision trees and scoring systems.
